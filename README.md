About game:
The graphics window has four panels, one per gene, color coding the individual agents. Initially, all four panels will look random, as in the screen-shot at the beginning of this article, but as the simulation progresses, it will look more like the screen-shot below, in which most agents have evolved to use r near 0.75 (light blue), and s near 0.12 (orange), with both p and q near 0.55 (green). This means that most of the agents eventually adopt a fighting strategy most of the time, with some random cooperation mixed in, with relatively little attention to their recent history of wins and losses.
This may or may not be attractive to anthropologists studying how cooperation could have evolved in nature. Our little game is not remarkably realistic, and the results depend on the specific pattern of scores we impose: change the "Game" table (or almost anything else about the simulation), and the equilibrium will also change. The point here is not so much whether this specific game has a meaningful interpretation in terms of human cultural development. Instead, it is intended to illustrate how simulations of this general flavor might shed light on exciting and complex phenomena if customized to be more realistic.
